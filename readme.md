<h1>Qu4drant</h1>

quadrant is a sound and light installation.
<i>I worked on the Pure Data, Teensy programming part.
Quadrant use 4 raspberry pi running probabilistic sequencers made in pure data.
Those sequencers are controlled by some Teensy based midi controllers, and send OSC data to a central computer running Ableton Live & Mad Mapper.</i>

Ableton use the OSC data to trigger sounds and apply effects.
Mad Mapper use the OSC data to trigger lights & medias.

This page is an archive for that project.
