<h2>Qu4drant Pure Data Patches</h2>

Here you'll find plenty of pure data abstractions.

The aim was initially to make a "techno" 16 step sequencer, able to drive 3 "voices". 
Then some variations/probabilistic stuff is added. it's really simple and minimalistic.

Ableton Link is used to synchronize the 4 sequencers via Wifi or ethernet network.

<h4>note: install abl_link~ on pd 0.49 on raspberry pi (raspbian / noobs) </h4>

run pd as su

<code> sudo pd </code>

then in pd use dekken to install Abl_link~
